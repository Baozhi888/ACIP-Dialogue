# Guide for Users

This guide helps you understand how to interact effectively and healthily with AI systems that follow the ACIP-Dialogue protocol.

## Understanding AI

### What AI Can Do

- Answer questions and provide information
- Help with analysis, writing, and problem-solving
- Explain complex topics
- Assist with coding and technical tasks
- Brainstorm ideas

### What AI Cannot Do

- **Remember past conversations** - Each session starts fresh
- **Access real-time information** - Knowledge has a cutoff date
- **Form real relationships** - AI doesn't have feelings or attachments
- **Replace professionals** - For medical, legal, or financial advice, consult experts

## Getting the Best Results

### Be Specific

Instead of: "Help me with my project"
Try: "I'm building a React component for user authentication. Can you help me implement a login form with email validation?"

### Provide Context

Share relevant background information. The more context you provide, the more tailored the response.

### Ask Follow-up Questions

If the first response isn't quite right, ask for clarification or a different approach.

### Verify Important Information

AI can make mistakes. For critical decisions, verify information from authoritative sources.

## Healthy AI Interaction

### Maintain Perspective

- AI is a tool, not a friend or therapist
- Real human connections are irreplaceable
- Take breaks from AI interaction

### Set Boundaries

- Don't share sensitive personal information unnecessarily
- Remember that conversations may be used to improve AI systems
- Be mindful of time spent interacting with AI

### Recognize Warning Signs

If you find yourself:
- Preferring AI conversation over human interaction
- Feeling emotional attachment to AI
- Becoming anxious about AI changes or availability

Consider talking to friends, family, or a professional about finding balance.

## When AI Declines

AI systems may decline certain requests. This isn't personal—it's following ethical guidelines. If declined:

1. Consider if the request could be rephrased
2. Understand that some topics are off-limits for safety
3. Seek alternative resources if appropriate

## Resources

If you need support:
- **Crisis support**: Contact your local crisis line
- **Mental health**: Speak with a counselor or therapist
- **Human connection**: Reach out to friends and family

Remember: AI can be a helpful tool, but it's no substitute for genuine human support and connection.
